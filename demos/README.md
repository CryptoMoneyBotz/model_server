# OpenVINO™ Model Server Demos

OpenVINO Model Server demos have been created to showcase the usage of the model server as well as demonstrate it’s capabilities. Check out the list below to see complete step-by-step examples of using OpenVINO Model Server with real world use cases:

- [Horizontal Text Detection in Real-Time](horizontal_text_detection) - run prediction on camera stream using a horizontal text detection model via gRPC API.

- [Optical Character Recognition Pipeline](optical_character_recognition) - run prediction on a JPEG image using a pipeline of text recognition and text detection models with a custom node for intermediate results processing via gRPC API.

- [Face Detection](face_detection) - run prediction on a JPEG image using face detection model via gRPC API.

- [Age, Gender and Emotion Recognition with Pipelined Models](face_anaysis_pipeline) - run prediction on a JPEG image using a pipeline of age-gender recognition and emotion recogition models via gRPC API.

- [Image Classification](image_classification) - run prediction on a JPEG image using image classification model via gRPC API.

- [Person, Vehicle, Bike Detection](person_bike_vehicle_detection) - run prediction on a video file or camera stream using person, vehicle, bike detection model via gRPC API.

- [Vehicle Analysis Pipeline](vehicle_analysis_pipeline) - detect vehicles and recognize their attributes using a pipeline of vehicle detection and vehicle attributes recognition models with a custom node for intermediate results processing via gRPC API.

- [Image Transformation Node](image_transformation_node) - learn about image transformation custom node that can transform input image to the format expected by the deep learning model.

- [Natural Language Processing with BERT](bert_question_answering) - provide a knowledge source and a query and use BERT model for question answering use case via gRPC API.

- [Working with Stateful Models](prediction_on_stateful_model) - run inference on a data sequence using stateful model via gRPC API.

- [Benchmark App](benchmark) - generate traffic and measure performance of the model served in OpenVINO Model Server.
